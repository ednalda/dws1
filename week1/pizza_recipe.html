    <h3>Making pizza:</h3>

    <p><ol>
    	<li> 
    	  Mix all the ingredients of the pizza dough in a large    bowl of an electric mixer for 15 minutes, until the dough is  smooth and elastic. Cover the pizza dough with a plastic for about an hour to double the size in a warm place.</li> <br /><br />

       <li>
       	  Place a pizza stone on a rack in the lower third of your oven. Preheat the oven to 450Â°F for at least 30 minutes, preferably an hour. Remove the plastic cover from the dough and punch the dough down so it deflates a bit. Divide the dough in half. Form two round balls of dough. Place each in its own bowl, cover with plastic and let sit for 10 minutes. Prepare your desired toppings. Note that you are not going to want to load up each pizza with a lot of toppings as the crust will end up not crisp that way. About a third a cup each of tomato sauce and cheese would be sufficient for one pizza. One to two mushrooms thinly sliced will cover a pizza.</li><br /><br />
      
       <li>
       	  Working one ball of dough at a time, take one ball of dough and flatten it with your hands on a slightly floured work surface. Starting at the center and working outwards, use your fingertips to press the dough to 1/2-inch thick. Turn and stretch the dough until it will not stretch further.Let the dough relax 5 minutes and then continue to stretch it until it reaches the desired diameter - 10 to 12 inches. Use your palm to flatten the edge of the dough where it is thicker. You can pinch the very edges if you want to form a lip.

       <li>
       	  Spoon on the tomato sauce, sprinkle with cheese, and place your desired toppings on the pizza. Sprinkle some cornmeal on the baking stone in the oven (watch your hands, the oven is hot!). Gently shake the peel to see if the dough will easily slide, if not, gently lift up the edges of the pizza and add a bit more cornmeal. Slide the pizza off of the peel and on to the baking stone in the oven. Bake pizza one at a time until the crust is browned and the cheese is golden, about 10-15 minutes. If you want, toward the end of the cooking time you can sprinkle on a little more cheese.
