           	           <p><b>Venice</b> is the capital of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veneto">Veneto</a> region. In 2009, there were 270,098 people residing in Venice's comune (the population estimate of 272,000 inhabitants includes the population of the whole Comune of Venezia; around 60,000 in the historic city of Venice (Centro storico); 176,000 in Terraferma (the Mainland), mostly in the large <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frazione">frazioni</a> of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mestre">Mestre</a> and <a href= "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marghera">Marghera</a>; 31,000 live on other islands in the lagoon). Together with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Padua,_Italy">Padua</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treviso,_Italy">Treviso</a>, the city is included in the Padua-Treviso-Venice Metropolitan Area (PATREVE), with a total population of 1,600,000. PATREVE is only a statistical metropolitan area without any degree of autonomy.</p>

           	  	 <h2 id="history">History</h2>
           	  	       <p>Although there are no historical records that deal directly with the founding of Venice,<a href="#1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> tradition and the available evidence have led several historians to agree that the original populationof Venice consisted of refugees from Roman cities near Venice such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Padua">Padua</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquileia">Aquileia</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treviso">Treviso</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altinum">Altino</a> and Concordia <q>modern Portogruaro</q> and from the undefended countryside, who were fleeing successive waves of Germanic and Hun invasions. <a href="#2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> Some late Roman sources reveal the existence of fishermen on the islands in the original marshy lagoons. They were referred to as incolae lacunae ("lagoon dwellers"). The traditional founding is identified with the dedication of the first church, that of San Giacomo at the islet of Rialto (Rivoalto, "High Shore"), which is said to have been at the stroke of noon on 25 March 421.</p>
           	  	       <p>In 751, the Lombard King Aistulf conquered most of the Exarchate of Ravenna, leaving Venice a lonely and increasingly autonomous Byzantine outpost. During this period, the seat of the local Byzantine governor (the "duke/dux", later "doge"), was situated in Malamocco. Settlement on the islands in the lagoon probably increased in correspondence with the Lombard conquest of other Byzantine territories as refugees sought asylum in the lagoon city.</p>
           	  	       <p>In 775/776, the episcopal seat of Olivolo (Helipolis) was created. During the reign of duke Agnello Particiaco (811â€“827), the ducal seat was moved from Malamocco to the highly protected Rialto, the current location of Venice. The monastery of <abbr title="Abbreviation of Sant">St.</abbr> Zachary and the first ducal palace and basilica of St. Mark, as well as a walled defense (civitatis murus) between Olivolo and Rialto, were subsequently built here. Winged lions, which may be seen throughout Venice, are a symbol for St. Mark.</p>

           	     <h2 id="economy">Economy</h2>
           	           <p>Venice's economy has changed throughout history. In the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Ages">Middle Ages</a> and the Renaissance, Venice was a major centre for commerce and trade, as it controlled a vast sea-empire, and became an extremely wealthy European city, a leader in political and economic affairs and a centre for trade and commerce.<a href="#3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> From the 11th century until the 15th century, pilgrimages to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Land">Holy Land</a> were offered in Venice. Other ports such as Genoa, Pisa, Marseille, Ancona and Dubrovnik were hardly able to make any competition to the well organized transportation of pilgrims from Venice. This all changed by the 17th century, when Venice's trade empire was taken over by other countries such as Portugal, and its naval importance was reduced. In the 18th century, then, it became a major agricultural and industrial exporter. The 18th century's biggest industrial complex was the Venice Arsenal, and the Italian Army still uses it today even though some space has been used for major theatrical and cultural productions, and beautiful spaces for art.<a href="#4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> Today, Venice's economy is mainly based on tourism, shipbuilding (mainly done in the neighbouring cities of Mestre and Porto Marghera), services, trade and industrial exports. Murano glass production in Murano and lace production in Burano are also highly important to the economy</p>
           	        <h3>Turism</h3>
           	          <p><q>Venice is one of the most important tourist destinations in the world for its celebrated art and architecture.</q> The city has an average of 50,000 tourists a day (2007 estimate). In 2006, it was the world's 28th most internationally visited city, with 2.927 million international arrivals that year. It is regarded as one of the world's most <strong>beautiful</strong> cities.</p>
           	           <h4>Public transport</h4>
                           <p><abbr title="Azienda del Consorzio Trasporti Veneziano">ACTV</abbr> is a public company responsible for public transportation in Venice.
                              <h5>Lagoon area</h5>
                                 <p>The main public transportation means are motorised waterbuses (vaporetti) which ply regular routes along the Grand Canal and between the city's islands. The only gondole still in common use by Venetians are the traghetti, foot passenger ferries crossing the Grand Canal at certain points without bridges.
                                 The Venice People Mover (managed by <abbr title="cable operated public transit system">ASM</abbr>) connecting Tronchetto island with Piazzale Roma. Water taxis are also active.</p>
           	        <h3>Waterways</h3>
                      <p>Venezia is a city of small islands, enhanced during the Middle Ages by the dredging of soils to raise the marshy ground above the tides. The resulting canals encouraged the flourishing of a nautical culture which proved central to the economy of the city. Today those canals still provide the means for transport of goods and people within the city.
                      The maze of canals threaded through the city requires the use of more than 400 bridges to permit the flow of foot traffic. In 2011, the city opened Ponte della Costituzione, the fourth bridge across the Grand Canal, connecting the Piazzale Roma bus terminal area with the Stazione Ferroviaria (train station), the others being the original Ponte di Rialto, the Ponte dell'Accademia, and the Ponte degli Scalzi.</p>
